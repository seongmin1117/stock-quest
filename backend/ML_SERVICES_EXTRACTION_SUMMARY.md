**Key Methods**:
- `generateSignalFromModel(String, SimpleTradingModel, MarketFeatures)` - Main signal generation
- `determineSignalType(int prediction)` - Signal type mapping
- `calculateConfidence(double, MarketFeatures)` - Confidence scoring
- `calculateSignalStrength(double, double[])` - Strength calculation

### 5. MarketIntelligenceService
**Location**: `com.stockquest.application.service.ml.MarketIntelligenceService`

**Responsibilities**:
- Market regime analysis and intelligence
- Signal enhancement with market context
- Market stress level assessment
- Portfolio recommendations

**Key Methods**:
- `enhanceSignalWithMarketIntelligence(TradingSignal, MarketFeatures)` - Signal enhancement
- `analyzeMarketStressLevel(MarketFeatures)` - Market stress analysis
- `isSignalValidForMarketRegime(TradingSignal, MarketRegime)` - Signal validation
- `generatePortfolioRecommendation(List<TradingSignal>, MarketCondition)` - Portfolio advice

## Updated MLTradingSignalService

The main service is now streamlined to 206 lines (down from 946) and focuses on:
- **Orchestration**: Coordinating the 5 specialized services
- **Workflow Management**: Managing the 4-step signal generation process
- **Async Processing**: Maintaining CompletableFuture-based async operations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserving existing interfaces for backtesting

### Main Workflow
```java
// 1. Market data collection
MarketFeatures features = marketFeatureCollectionService.collectMarketFeatures(symbol);

// 2. Model management  
SimpleTradingModel model = mlModelManagementService.getOrTrainModel(symbol);

// 3. Signal generation
TradingSignal signal = signalGenerationService.generateSignalFromModel(symbol, model, features);

// 4. Market intelligence enhancement
marketIntelligenceService.enhanceSignalWithMarketIntelligence(signal, features);
```

## Architectural Benefits

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each service now has a single, clear purpose and focused responsibilities.

### Dependency Injection
All services use constructor injection with `@RequiredArgsConstructor` for clean dependencies.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages and fallback strategies.

### Logging
Consistent logging patterns using `@Slf4j` with appropriate log levels.

### Builder Pattern DTOs
- `MarketFeatures` - Market data aggregation
- `TrainingData` - ML training datasets  
- `ModelCacheStats` - Model management statistics
- `PortfolioRecommendation` - Investment recommendations

## Testing Results

✅ **Compilation Success**: All services compile without errors
✅ **Interface Compatibility**: Existing method signatures preserved
✅ **Dependency Resolution**: All Spring dependencies properly injected
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling in place

## Code Metrics

| Service | Lines | Primary Focus |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| MarketFeatureCollectionService | ~180 | Market data & analysis |
| MLModelManagementService | ~195 | Model lifecycle & caching |
| FeatureEngineeringService | ~290 | Technical indicators & features |
| SignalGenerationService | ~280 | Signal generation & reasoning |

## Future Enhancements

The extracted services provide a solid foundation for:
- Advanced ML model integration (Smile, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Real-time feature streaming
- Model A/B testing and experimentation  
- Advanced portfolio optimization algorithms
- Enhanced market regime detection

Each service can now evolve independently while maintaining the clean separation of concerns.
